# Why CMMS Projects Fail (And How to Fix It)

70% of CMMS implementations fail due to bad data. Not bad software. Not lack of training. Bad data.

After years in maintenance and reliability engineering, I've watched companies spend millions on CMMS systems that never deliver value because the data was fundamentally broken from day one.

## The Real Problem

Your team is stuck in an endless cycle:
- Cleaning data in Excel spreadsheets
- Emailing versions back and forth
- Finding errors after importing to the CMMS
- Starting over

It's frustrating, expensive, and completely avoidable.

## A Better Way

That's why we built AssetStage - a purpose-built workspace where CMMS data problems actually get solved.

**What makes it different:**

✅ **Visual hierarchy builder** - See your entire asset structure at once. Drag, drop, reorganize thousands of assets instantly. No formulas required.

✅ **Team collaboration** - Multiple users working together in real-time. No more emailing Excel files around.

✅ **Real-time validation** - Catch errors before they reach your CMMS, not after.

✅ **Bulk operations** - Fix 1000 errors with one click instead of 1000 manual corrections.

✅ **Excel compatible** - Works with your existing CMMS loading templates. Import, clean, export.

✅ **Complete audit trail** - Know who changed what, when. Meet compliance requirements with confidence.

## The Results

- **6-week delivery** instead of 6-month consulting projects
- **90% cost savings** compared to traditional implementations
- **Works with any CMMS** - Maximo, SAP PM, Oracle, and more

## The Bottom Line

Stop accepting bad data as inevitable. Your CMMS is only as good as the data you put in it.

Enterprise-quality data staging shouldn't require enterprise budgets or expensive consultants.
