PHASE 3: ISO 14224 INTEGRATION (Weeks 7-10)
===========================================

[ ] Equipment Boundaries Definition
    - Define what constitutes each equipment item
    - Set clear boundaries between systems
    - Document equipment hierarchies

[ ] Failure Mode Classification
    - Implement ISO 14224 failure categories
    - Create standardized failure codes
    - Map to existing maintenance history

[ ] Maintenance Data Standardization
    - Standardize work order types
    - Implement ISO 14224 maintenance categories:
      * Preventive Maintenance (PM)
      * Corrective Maintenance (CM)
      * Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)
      * Modifications

[ ] Reliability Data Collection
    - Set up failure tracking
    - Configure downtime recording
    - Establish maintenance action codes

ISO 14224 Equipment Classes (Maritime Focus):
- Rotating Equipment: Pumps, Compressors, Motors
- Static Equipment: Tanks, Heat Exchangers, Piping
- Electrical Equipment: Generators, Switchgear, Motors
- Safety Systems: Fire detection, Emergency shutdown
- Control Systems: Navigation, Automation, SCADA


PHASE 4: CMMS PLATFORM INTEGRATION (Weeks 11-12)
================================================

[ ] AMOS Configuration
    - Set up SFI-based equipment trees
    - Configure ISO 14224 failure hierarchies
    - Create standardized PM templates

[ ] Maximo Setup (if applicable)
    - Configure asset templates
    - Set up classification structures
    - Implement failure reporting

[ ] SAP PM Configuration (if applicable)
    - Create functional locations using SFI
    - Set up equipment master data
    - Configure maintenance plans

[ ] Data Validation
    - Verify all equipment has both SFI codes and ISO boundaries
    - Test failure reporting workflows
    - Validate maintenance scheduling


PHASE 5: TRAINING & ROLLOUT (Weeks 13-14)
=========================================

[ ] Training Materials
    - Create SFI quick reference guides
    - Develop ISO 14224 failure reporting guides
    - Record training videos for key processes

[ ] User Training
    - Train maintenance planners
    - Train deck officers and engineers
    - Train shore-based superintendents

[ ] Pilot Testing
    - Run parallel systems for 2 weeks
    - Collect feedback from users
    - Refine processes based on feedback

[ ] Full Deployment
    - Roll out to remaining vessels
    - Monitor data quality metrics
    - Provide ongoing support


PHASE 6: MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION (Ongoing)
============================================

[ ] Quality Metrics Tracking
    - Monitor data completeness
    - Track user adoption rates
    - Measure maintenance efficiency gains

[ ] Continuous Improvement
    - Regular data quality audits
    - User feedback sessions
    - Process refinements

[ ] Benchmarking
    - Compare performance across vessels
    - Industry benchmarking where possible
    - Share best practices fleet-wide

Success Metrics to Track:
- % of equipment with complete SFI codes
- % of work orders with proper ISO 14224 data
- Reduction in parts search time
- Improvement in first-time fix rates
- Maintenance cost per vessel/per hour
- Equipment availability improvements
