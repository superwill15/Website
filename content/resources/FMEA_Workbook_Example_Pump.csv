Action Summary - Items Ranked by RPN:
,RPN,Item,Recommended Action,Priority
,162,Mechanical Seal (dry run),Add low-flow alarm and interlock,HIGH
,150,Impeller erosion,Install strainer upstream; quarterly inspection,HIGH
,140,Mechanical Seal (wear),Install seal flush system,MEDIUM - COMPLETE
,120,Suction Strainer,DP indicator with high alarm,MEDIUM
,96,Motor Winding,Annual motor analysis - COMPLETE,MEDIUM
,96,Impeller cavitation,Suction pressure alarm; strainer DP monitoring,MEDIUM
,90,Check Valve,Quarterly inspection; monthly exercise,MEDIUM
,80,Bearing seizure,Bearing temperature monitors,MEDIUM
,72,Bearing vibration - COMPLETE,Vibration monitoring established,LOW
,64,Shaft fatigue,Annual NDT inspection,LOW

Key Findings:
"1. Highest risk items relate to mechanical seal and impeller - common for seawater service"
"2. Seal flush system addresses primary wear mechanism (abrasives)"
"3. Low-flow protection critical to prevent dry running during startup"
"4. Strainer maintenance is key preventive measure"
"5. Several items can be addressed with improved condition monitoring"

Next Steps:
"1. Complete high-priority items before Q2 2025"
"2. Schedule remaining medium-priority items"
"3. Review FMEA after implementing changes"
"4. Update RPN values based on actual performance data"
"5. Conduct annual FMEA review"
