SEVERITY SCALE (S)
Rating,Effect,Criteria
10,Hazardous - No Warning,"Sudden failure causing injury, death, or environmental catastrophe without warning"
9,Hazardous - With Warning,"Failure causing injury, death, or environmental catastrophe with warning"
8,Very High,"Equipment destroyed, major production loss (>1 week), regulatory violation"
7,High,"Major equipment damage, significant production loss (days), safety system impaired"
6,Moderate,"Moderate equipment damage, production loss (8-24 hours), quality affected"
5,Low,"Minor equipment damage, production loss (4-8 hours)"
4,Very Low,"Cosmetic damage, minor production impact (<4 hours)"
3,Minor,Slight inconvenience to operations
2,Very Minor,Negligible effect noticed by operator
1,None,No effect

OCCURRENCE SCALE (O)
Rating,Probability,Failure Rate
10,Very High,">100 per 1000 operating hours (daily or more)"
9,High,"50-100 per 1000 hours (weekly)"
8,High,"20-50 per 1000 hours (every 2 weeks)"
7,Moderately High,"10-20 per 1000 hours (monthly)"
6,Moderate,"5-10 per 1000 hours (quarterly)"
5,Moderate,"2-5 per 1000 hours (semi-annually)"
4,Moderately Low,"1-2 per 1000 hours (annually)"
3,Low,"0.5-1 per 1000 hours (every 2 years)"
2,Very Low,"0.1-0.5 per 1000 hours (every 5 years)"
1,Remote,"<0.1 per 1000 hours (unlikely)"

DETECTION SCALE (D)
Rating,Detection Method,Likelihood of Detection
10,No Detection,"No known controls, failure not detectable"
9,Very Remote,Very unlikely to detect (unmonitored system)
8,Remote,Controls unlikely to detect (infrequent inspection)
7,Very Low,Very low chance of detection (annual inspection only)
6,Low,Low chance of detection (quarterly inspection)
5,Moderate,Moderate chance of detection (monthly inspection + basic monitoring)
4,Moderately High,Moderately high chance (weekly checks + trend analysis)
3,High,High chance of detection (continuous monitoring with alerts)
2,Very High,Very high chance (automated detection + shutdown)
1,Almost Certain,Failure prevented by design (fail-safe mechanisms)

RPN INTERPRETATION
RPN Range,Priority,Action Required
500-1000,Critical - Immediate Action,Stop operation if safe to do so. Implement corrective action immediately.
250-499,High Priority,Plan corrective action within 1 week. Increase monitoring.
125-249,Medium Priority,Schedule corrective action within 1 month. Review during next PM.
50-124,Low Priority,Address during next scheduled maintenance window.
1-49,Monitor Only,No immediate action required. Review during annual FMEA update.

COMMON FAILURE CAUSES
Category,Typical Causes
Design,"Inadequate capacity, Wrong material selection, Poor accessibility, Missing redundancy"
Fabrication,"Welding defects, Machining errors, Assembly errors, Material defects"
Installation,"Misalignment, Improper support, Wrong orientation, Piping stress"
Operations,"Operating outside limits, Incorrect startup/shutdown, Process upset"
Maintenance,"Inadequate PM, Wrong parts, Improper repair, Missed inspection"
Environmental,"Corrosion, Erosion, Temperature extremes, Vibration, Contamination"

Instructions:
"1. Fill in header information (company, equipment, date, team)"
"2. List each component in the Equipment/Component column"
"3. Define the function of each component"
"4. Identify potential failure modes (how it could fail)"
"5. Describe effects at local level and system level"
"6. Identify root causes for each failure mode"
"7. Rate Severity (S), Occurrence (O), and Detection (D) using the scales above"
"8. Calculate RPN = S x O x D"
"9. Prioritize actions based on RPN and severity"
"10. Assign owners and target dates for high-priority items"
"11. After implementing actions, re-score and calculate new RPN"
"12. Review and update FMEA at least annually"
