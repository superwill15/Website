# ISO 14224 for Non-Oil & Gas Industries
## Applying Proven Reliability Standards to Manufacturing, Utilities, and Beyond

---

## Why Use ISO 14224 Outside Oil & Gas?

ISO 14224 was developed for petroleum and petrochemical industries, but its core concepts apply universally:

- **Consistent equipment taxonomy** - Works for any rotating/static equipment
- **Standardized failure codes** - Pumps fail the same way in any industry
- **Data collection framework** - Structured reliability data benefits everyone
- **Industry benchmarking** - Some data is transferable across industries

### What You Get from ISO 14224

| Benefit | Value for Non-O&G |
|---------|-------------------|
| Equipment classification | Organize any industrial asset |
| Failure mode codes | Standardize failure recording |
| Failure mechanism codes | Understand why things fail |
| Data collection requirements | Know what to record |
| Boundary definitions | Clear scope for analysis |

### What You Need to Adapt

| ISO 14224 Element | Adaptation Needed |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Industry/Business Category (Levels 1-2) | Replace with your industry structure |
| Installation/Plant (Levels 3-4) | Map to your facility structure |
| Equipment classes | Use applicable classes, add custom |
| Failure codes | Use as-is, excellent universal fit |
| Data fields | Use relevant fields, skip O&G-specific |
