*October 2025 Product Update*

## The Feature You've Been Asking For

PM Optimization is now available in AssetStage.

If you've ever tried to standardize preventive maintenance schedules across identical equipment, you know the pain. Export to Excel. Compare dozens of schedules. Copy and paste for hours. Import back. Hope nothing breaks.

Not anymore.

## What It Does

**See the problem clearly**
- View all PM schedules for identical assets side-by-side
- Differences are highlighted automatically
- Spot over-maintenance and under-maintenance instantly

**Fix it quickly**
- Select your standard PM template (or create one)
- Apply to all similar assets with one click
- Full validation before applying changes

**Track everything**
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Before/after comparisons
- Export ready for your CMMS

## Real Results from Beta Users

We've been testing this with a few early users:

- **Cohesive (CMMS Consultancy)**: Cut PM standardization time from 3 days to 3 hours on their latest Maximo implementation
- **Manufacturing Site**: Found 30% of their pumps were over-maintained, saving Â£40K annually after optimization
- **Post-Merger Integration**: Standardized two different maintenance philosophies into one coherent strategy in under a week

## How to Get Started

**Already an AssetStage user?**
PM Optimization is available now in your Professional or Enterprise tier. Look for the "PM Optimization" tab in your main navigation.

**New to AssetStage?**

We have special partnership pricing. This feature alone will save you days per project. Contact us for details.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Upload your data** - Export your PMs from your CMMS
2. **Select asset type** - Start with one type (e.g., centrifugal pumps)
3. **Review the comparison** - See all PM variations side-by-side
4. **Choose your standard** - Pick the best existing PM or create new
5. **Apply and export** - Update all selected assets and export back to CMMS

The whole process takes about 15-30 minutes for a typical asset type.

## What's Different About Our Approach

We're not trying to AI-optimize your maintenance or predict failures. This is simpler:

- Show you what you have
- Help you standardize it
- Get out of your way

No consultants needed. No complex implementation. Just upload, fix, export.

## Coming Next

PM Optimization is just the start. Next quarter we're adding:
- **Schedule Smoothing** - Balance PM workload across weeks/months to avoid resource peaks visually

But today, we're focused on PM standardization. Because that's where the biggest quick wins are.

## One Last Thing

If you've been manually standardizing PMs in Excel, I'm sorry. I've been there. It's mind-numbing work that nobody appreciates.

That's why we built this. Maintenance teams have real problems to solve. Spreadsheet wrestling shouldn't be one of them.
